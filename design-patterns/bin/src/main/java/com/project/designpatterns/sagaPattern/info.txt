This is a Micro-service architectural design pattern.

But i am trying to bring forth the scenario, using multi-threading.


. 2 popular ways of handling transaction consistency in a distributed
 system is by having  a 
 
 1. orchestratorService like Axon 
 
 2. Choreography (where each microservice monitors all the events and 
  handles its domain independently be in commit or rollback of a transaction.)
 . But this is not efficient for large event based systems.
