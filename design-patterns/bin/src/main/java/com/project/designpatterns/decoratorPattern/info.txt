flow of the design pattern:
	
	DataSource<Interface>  implemented by Abstract class called DataSourceDecorator
	the Abstract class is extended by FileDecorator, EncrytptionDecorator, CompressDecorator

	Then, file is wrapped inside Encryption -> inside CompressorDecorator.
	finally the data is read and written. by calling the interface methods.
