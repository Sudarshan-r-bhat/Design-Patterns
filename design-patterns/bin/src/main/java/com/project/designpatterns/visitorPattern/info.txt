Flow of Design:
	driver class[list of all nodes] , 
	Nodes[visitor class reference, accept method]
	visitor[method impl which are invoked by nodes]
	Data transfer objects for communication b/w nodes and visitor.
	
	
----------------- Notes: ----------------
. visitor pattern uses a technique called double-dispatch.

. you would be maintaining, a visitor class, which maintains a method implementation
 for each of the nodes.
 
. Each of the node class will implement a method accept() which will recognize the visitor class 
 and call an appropriate method of visitor and pass appropriate argument.
