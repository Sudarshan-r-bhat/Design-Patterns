Problem statement:
	
	- you need to be able to have multiple UserApplications.
	- you need to be able to have reusable updates that can be applied 
	 on UserApplication
	- on a single push signal on UserApplication all the updates should get 
	applied.



Flow of Design:

	. Abstract Subject(userApplication) -> Subjects (SpringUsers)
	. Abstract Observers (updates) -> multiple udpate objects (ui, marketplace, etc)
	
	. Subject should maintain a list of all observers, 
	 should have a method to add more observers.
	
	. Abstract Observer should have a abstract method to be implemented by 
	 every observer.
	. Every Observer should be able to accept a Subject, to attach itself.
