Flow of design pattern:
	. State is a extension of Strategy design pattern.
	. In state, the current state machine is aware of its next state after a certain process. but not in strategy pattern.
	 
	- you create an interface with method which process the data and sets the state machine/context to
	 the next state.
	. 




/* 
 	Here you will create 3 states for document processing state.
	. draft
	. moderate
	. publish

*/

---------------	notes	------------------------------------

My wrong assumptions:
	you define N states. each state will have a reference variable to nextState
	when a document is passed to the state its processed and as a chain its passed to 
	process in the next state.
	this assumption is some-what like chain of responsibility pattern.
	
Right way and why its right:
	The previous assumption doesn't maintain any state information in the document.
	say you send the document to an external system, it won't know the current state of the document.
	
	states basically represents the algorithms or procedures that are applied to the document.(State of the document)
