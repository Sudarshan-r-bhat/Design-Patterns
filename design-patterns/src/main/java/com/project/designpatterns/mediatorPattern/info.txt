Flow of Design pattern:
	It is also based on composition.
	Every object will keep a reference to the Mediator object.
	
	and Mediator object will maintain a reference to all other objects
	to properly delegate and execute method of these objects.
	
	
--------------	notes    --------------------
 - This pattern is helpful to prevent code smell, to keep the 
  code loosely coupled.
