Flow of the design pattern:
	
	. You will have to maintain a Prototype registry, which will 
	 maintain the original copies.
	
	. every object that is stored in the registry will implement clone() method. / simply use a 
	 interface or abstract class.
	
	.  NOte: clone() method will not create a deep copy of objects. It will create shallow copy.
	 meaning similar data of original object will be stored in different memory location.
