Flow of design pattern:
	Caretaker class 
	Originator class [ Memento class ]

note: change you're perspective, Originator is not the Primary class, But CareTaker is.

-------------   notes    ----------------------------------------

you  will have a Caretaker object which will store a reference to originator' object 
and also the history of all snapshots.


originator will have reference to State/memento to save and restore the snapshot/Memento.

Memento will have getters and setter to fetch all the state variables.

And only originator will have methods to store and restore the snapshot. Ofcourse memento
will have a public method restore.

but the history of memento's will be private fields in the Caretaker object. hence only
originator will be able to store and restore the memento.
