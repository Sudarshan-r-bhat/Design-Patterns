# MEMENTO DESIGN PATTERN
It is a Behavioural design pattern . You can use this pattern when you need to store state of a
application and provide undo operations.

## EXAMPLE
Let's say you are building a text editor app, obviously you need to provide undo operation feature,
so you can revert back N number of times and continue editing. And create new state on every text 
edit.
